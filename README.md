# Personal Cheat Website
This is a personal website that I've made by myself, I used figma to create the original design
Then used a mix of node js and several libraries combined with html & css to create the website according to the design. 


The validation with JS is all server sided express, clients will not be able to see your code at all. 

License of the repository is available at the bottom, for further clarification please consider reading the license terms.
